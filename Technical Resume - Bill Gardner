PRINCIPAL SOFTWARE / SYSTEMS ENGINEER

Profile

Full life-cycle project experience in developing and delivering complex system specifications/architectures, real-time embedded software (C/C++), distributed middleware (C++/C#/.Net/Java/Python/JavaScript/Perl), and digital hardware designs for military vendors and the telecom industry.  Strong analytical, problem solving, and communication skills.  Accomplished experience with requirement gathering/analysis, product specification, object-oriented analysis & design, software integration & testing, hardware board design, and system engineering functions.

Accomplished Technical Projects 

•	Produced embedded, data-based driven, space flight software for commercial space satellites in C++/ADA/Integrity-178 RTOS that processes in-coming CCSDS-based commands sent from earth ground stations and that sends telemetry data of internal satellite operations & on-board payload data back to earth ground stations.    
•	Produced military air vehicle subsystem software in C++/Linux in an Agile/Atlassian program management environment that provides an ‘intelligent’ communications gateway to effectively analyze, translate, and construct a host of tactically planned, mission-plan route events into commands that natively interface to an air vehicle management system used in front-line U.S. military aircraft.
•	Produced software requirements, architecture design and low-level ‘servlet’ software in C++/Linux that acts as an operational infrastructure ‘backbone’ to an Open-Mission-System (OMS), mission management architecture for advanced U.S. military aircraft.
•	Produced automated test scripts in Python, JavaScript, and Google Test to officially verify & validate functional execution of embedded software that operates military air vehicle subsystems based on formal Air Vehicle Management system requirements.
•	Per NSA directives, delivered embedded software security improvements in C/C++/Linux in an Agile environment on JTRS, Wideband Network Software Defined Radios (WNT SDR) for the U.S. Navy.
•	Produced and tested tactical airspace interface software in C#/.NET & Java/XML in Windows for the U.S. Army TAIS system that addressed the real-time network integration of tactical airspace support with ground-based vehicles and war fighters in theater.
•	Produced and tested embedded sensor software in C/Linux that manages image intensified (I2) and infrared thermal electronics for U.S. military-grade, low power Enhance Night Vision Goggles.
•	Produced and tested distributed, object-oriented middleware in C++/UNIX that governs the operation, administration, maintenance, and provisioning of Samsung’s UMTS WCDMA SoftSwitch Next Generation Network System (NGNS), a cellular switch.
•	Produced real-time embedded software in C/VRTXsa that manages a PowerQUICC-based, communications interface affecting the configuration, provisioning, operational control, and status of PCM voice channels on a Motorola cable port communications modem.
•	Conducted requirements trace, decomposition, mapping, and gap analysis assessments in Telelogic DOORS & VBA scripts of ground platform sensor requirements allocated by the C4ISR LSI (Raytheon) of the Future-Combat-System Program (FCS).
•	Produced real-time embedded IS-95B CDMA/AMPS mobile phone software in an ARM7Thumb/ANSI C/NucleusPlus RTOS environment that provides complete data link and network services for all forward and reverse link code channels for Ericsson’s first CDMA cellular phone in North America.
•	Developed multiple hardware device drivers in Unix for memory modules (ROM, DRAM. FLASH, EEPROM), hardware controllers (interrupt/DMA, FPGAs, PALs), serial bus controllers (Ethernet, UART, SPI, I2C), power management, and programmable timers.
•	Designed and tested numerous microprocessor-based, FPGA-driven data acquisition boards for General Dynamics’ F-16 Block 30/40 programs, which were used to condition, scale, format, record, and simulate electrical signaling data and data packet information in avionics flight trainers and avionics equipment bays for the U.S. Air Force and foreign customers.
