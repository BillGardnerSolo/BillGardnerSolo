Hello Oxide,

This introduction is in response to Oxide's search for a 'Software Engineer - Embedded Systems'.

For the past six months I have been working remotely full-time on a successful basis in Melbourne, Florida, as a Senior Embedded Flight Software Engineer for Maxar Technologies – a space technology company headquarted in Westminster, Colorada – on embedded, data-base driven, space flight software that controls & configures satellite subsystems and on-board payloads, that controls the flight orbital path & positional attitude of satellites and attached sensors relative to earth stations, and that reports the health status of satellite subsystems and on-board payloads back to earth stations.

Recently, Maxar announced their decision to layoff employees who refuse to take the Covid-19 inoculations that are now mandated by the U.S. government for companies with 100 employees and up.   Due to strongly held, personal convictions, I have refused to take the forced inoculations, but was willing to be screened, wear a facial mask, and maintain ‘social distancing’ on site at Maxar’s facilities, if on very rare occasions I needed to visit for a week or two at the Maxar site.  Although my counter proposal is now under adjudication board review, Maxar has been insistent that all employees take the forced inoculations, even if one is working remotely hundred of miles away.  As such, my position is being threaten, despite the fact that my performance has been consistently outstanding and has fully met satellite program requirements.

Prior to Maxar, I worked full-time for 7 years as a Principle Software Engineer with a DOD Secret clearance for Northrop Grumman Aeronautics Systems (NGAS) in Melbourne, Florida, on classified projects for military aircraft avionics/mission systems that are developed in a multi-process/multi-threaded, C++ development environment.  During the last 2 years at NGAS, I produced automated test scripts in Python and JavaScript that officially test verified & validated functional execution of Operational Flight Software (OFP) that manages and operates various subsystems in advanced military aircraft, per formal SRS requirements.

For the past 20+ years my technical background also involved designing, developing & testing embedded software and hardware platforms in C/C++/scripting languages (Python, JavaScript, Perl, Bash) in a Linux/Unix/Integrity RTOS environment that involves communication busses common to aerial platforms and other tactical systems, such as MIL-STD-1553B, IEEE 1394 Firewire, CAN Bus, Ethernet, UART, SPI, I2C.  

In terms of team collaboration experience, I’ve interfaced extensively with program management and team members in an Agile/Atlassian tool suite environment that utilizes git, Jira, Bamboo, BitBucket. Fisheye, Confluence and HipChat.

I welcome the opportunity to speak with Oxide about producing embedded software on Oxide computers on a remote basis.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Bill Gardner
